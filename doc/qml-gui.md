# QML-BASED GUI BUILD NOTES

NOTE: This is an experimental feature.

**DO NOT USE BUILDS FROM THIS REPO FOR REAL MONEY TRANSACTIONS!**


Currently, only Debian-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint etc) are supported.

To build the QML-based GUI, besides dependencies mentioned in [build-unix.md](build-unix.md),
additional dependencies are required:

```
sudo apt install qtdeclarative5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev
```
